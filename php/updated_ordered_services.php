// Handle the AJAX request to update selected services

// Retrieve service ID and selection status from POST request
$serviceId = $_POST['service_id'];
$selected = $_POST['selected'];

// You need to implement code here to update the list of selected services in your database.
// For example, you can insert or delete records from a table that tracks the selected services for each user.

// After updating the database, you can send a response back to the client if needed.
// For example:
// echo json_encode(['success' => true]);
